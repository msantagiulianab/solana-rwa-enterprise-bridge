### Scaffold: Spring Boot 3 Backend & Local PostgreSQL

**Decisions:**
- Established a Maven multi-layer backend under `backend/` with Java 17 + Spring Boot 3.3.x.
- Dependencies selected: Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, PostgreSQL Driver (runtime), Lombok, Bean Validation, and `spring-boot-starter-test` (JUnit 5, Mockito).
- `application.yml` contains **zero hardcoded secrets**. Datasource URL/username/password, server port, and Solana Devnet RPC URL/private key are all injected via environment variables (`SPRING_DATASOURCE_*`, `SOLANA_DEVNET_*`) with local-dev defaults only.
- `hibernate.ddl-auto: validate` — schema drift will be rejected; migrations to be managed via Flyway in a later phase.
- Added root `docker-compose.yml` for local PostgreSQL 16 with a named volume and healthcheck, parameterized by `POSTGRES_*` env vars.
- Expanded `.env.example` to cover both Compose (`POSTGRES_*`) and Spring (`SPRING_DATASOURCE_*`, `SOLANA_DEVNET_*`) variables.

**Tests added:** none yet (scaffold only; TDD begins with the compliance gatekeeper and Solana RPC services).

**Spring/Solana interactions:** Solana RPC URL + private key are bound from the environment under the `solana.rpc.*` configuration prefix, ready for the `SolanaRpcService` mock-backed unit tests.
